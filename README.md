## What does it do?

* Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.
* Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.
* Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
* Improves usability with subtle modifications.

## What I did

## Normalize.css Vs Normal.css

* This version doesn't contain extra code for elements like :- sub,sup,small,fieldset,legend,progress,details,summary,template
* NO CODE FOR SOLVING ISSUES WITH INTERNET EXPLORER

## Browser support
